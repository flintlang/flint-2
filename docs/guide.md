ðŸŽ‰ First of all, thank you for the interest in Flint! ðŸŽ‰  
  
Although blockchain platforms, such as [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) and [Libra](https://libra.org), require smart contract programmers to ensure the correct behaviour of their program before deployment, they don't provide high level languages designed with safety in mind. Solidity and others do not tailor for blockchain's unique programming model and instead, mimic existing popular languages like JavaScript, Python, or C, without providing additional safety mechanisms.  
  
Flint changes that, as a new programming language built for easily writing safe smart contracts. Flint is approachable to both experienced and new blockchain developers, and presents a variety of security features. Much of the language syntax is inspired by [the Swift language](https://swift.org/), making it more approachable than Solidity.  
 
For a quick start, please have a look at the [Installation](#installation) section first, followed by the [Example](#example) section.

_Note: throughout the document, the tag `unimplemented` will be used to indicate that this particular feature of the language is either unimplemented or only partially implemented_

# Getting started  
  
## Installation  
  
### Building from source  
_This is currently the advised way of installing Flint_  
  
#### Prerequisites  
The following must be installed to build Flint:  

 * Rust
 * LLVM 10, including static libraries
 * Libstdc++
 
##### Ubuntu

To install prerequisites on Ubuntu, run:

```bash
sudo apt install llvm-10-dev
```

##### Fedora

To install prerequisites on Fedora, run:

```bash
sudo dnf install llvm-devel llvm-static libstdc++-devel
```
  
##### For testing  
Additionally, to run the testing libraries, install:  

 * Python 3
 * Libra 
  
#### Install  
Assuming you have all the prerequisites, you should be able to build flint by running  
  
```bash  
git clone https://www.github.com/flintlang/flint-2.git
cd flint-2
cargo build
```  
  
##### Future plans
*There are plans to streamline the installation process, either by providing binaries or a repository package*

#### Errors

##### No suitable version of LLVM was found

```bash
No suitable version of LLVM was found system-wide or pointed
          to by LLVM_SYS_100_PREFIX.
```

LLVM is not installed on the system, or a development version is needed. Try installing a package named similar to `llvm-dev`, depending on your distro.

##### Cannot find `lstdc++`

```bash
note: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++
          collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

Your installation is missing `libstdc++`. Either install it directly, or install `g++`.

##### Undefined reference to `LLVM...`

```bash
undefined reference to `LLVM...'  # Such as `LLVMDisposeTargetData'
          collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

Your installation is missing LLVM's static libraries. The package should be named similar to `llvm-static`,
depending on your distro.

## Example  
  
This section demonstrates the full workflow of writing a smart contract in Flint and compiling it
  
### Creating a simple contract  
  
The first step is to create a Flint source file. Our example smart contract will be a simple counter. It will have a state â€“ the number of "hits". Its current value can be displayed by calling its `getValue` function. Its value can be increased by calling its `hit` function.  
  
We create a file called `main.flint` and put the following code in it: 
 
<!-- TODO pick a better example with money coming in -->
```swift  
// This is the declaration of the contract. In this simple example, it only  
// includes the one state variable, `hits`.  
contract Counter {  
 // `hits` will initially be `0` and it will be an integer variable (`Int`).
    var hits: Int = 0
}  
  
// These are the functions of the contract. The `:: (any)` indicates that  
// these functions can be called by anyone on the Ethereum network.  
Counter :: (any) {  
    // This is the constructor, called when the contract is first created. There 
    // is nothing we need to do here at this point, so it is empty. public init() {}  
    // This function returns the current counter value. It takes no arguments, 
    // but returns an `Int`. 
    public func getValue() -> Int { return hits }
    
    public func hit(value: Libra) mutates (hits) { hits += 1 }
}  
````  
  
### Compiling `Counter`  
  
We can compile `Counter` using the terminal command:  
  
```bash  
$ cargo run (libra|ethereum) main.flint
```  

*In the future, it should be easier to install so running through cargo is no longer necessary*
  
## IDE integration  
  
Flint has language integrations for [VS Code](#vs-code), [Vim](#vim), and [Atom](#atom), although this is currently only support for syntax highlighting, not inline error / warning display.  
  
### VS Code  
  
Install the `flint-colour` package from the VS Code Marketplace.
  
### Vim  
  
Syntax highlighting can be activated in Vim by using the following command in the Flint repository:  
  
```bash  
$ ditto utils/vim ~/.vim  
```  
  
### Atom  
  
Syntax highlighting in Atom can be obtained by installing the [`language-flint` package](https://atom.io/packages/language-flint).  
  
## Compilation  
  
Flint compiles Flint source code to IR designed to integrate with other contracts.
  
A Flint source file named `main.flint` containing a contract `Counter` can be compiled to a blockchain-specific IR file using:  
  
```bash  
$ cargo run (libra|ethereum) main.flint
```  
  
There are more command-line options available in `flintc`. To show a full listing, use:  
  
```bash  
$ flintc --help  
```  
  
# Language guide  
  
## File structure  
  
Flint files consist of one or more [contract declarations](#contracts), and optionally [struct declarations](#structs), [trait declarations](#traits), [external contract declarations](#external-calls), and/or [enumerations](#enumerations).  
  
### Comments  
  
Comments may be used throughout the source code. Comments are started with a double slash `//` and continue to the end of that line.  
  
## Types  
  
Flint is a statically-typed language with a simple type system, with basic support for subtyping through [traits](#traits).
  
### Basic types  
  
| Type | Description |  
| --- | --- |  
| `Int` | 64-bit integer. |  
| `Address` | 160-bit Ethereum address. |  
| `Bool` | Boolean value. |  
| `String` | String value. Currently limited to 256 bits, i.e. 32 bytes. `unimplemented` |  
| `Void` | Non-value. Note that the `Void` type is never directly used. It is implicit when a function has no return type. |  
  
### Dynamic types  
  
| Name | Type (in code) | Description |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Dynamic-size list | `[T]` | A list of elements of type `T`. Elements can be added to it or removed from it. `unimplemented (eWASM)`|  
| Fixed-size list | `T[n]` | A list containing `n` elements of type `T`. It cannot have a different number of elements than its declared capacity `n`. `unimplemented (move)` |  
| Dictionary | `[K: V]` | Dynamic-size mappings from one key type `K` to a value type `V`. Each stored key of type `K` is associated with one value of type `V`. |  
| Polymorphic self | `Self` | See [polymorphic self](#polymorphic-self). |  
| Structs | | Structs (structures), including [user-defined structs](#structs). |  
  
<!-- TODO for loops/range types may not be implemented ### Range types  
  
Flint includes two range types, which are shortcuts for expressing ranges of values. These can only be used with `for-in` loops.  
  
The half-open range (`a..<b`) defines a range that runs from `a` to `b`, but does not include `b`.  
  
```swift  
for let i: Int in (0..<5) {  
 // i will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 on separate iteratons}  
```  
  
The open range operator (`a...b`) defines a range that runs from `a` to `b` and does include `b`.  
  
```swift  
for let i: Int in (0...5) {  
 // i will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on separate iteratons}  
```  
  
At the moment, both `a` and `b` must be integer literals, not variables!  
  
 > **Planned feature** > > In the future, it will be possible to iterate up to an arbitrary value. See https://github.com/flintlang/flint/issues/397.  -->
<!-- ### External types  
  
When specifying an [external interface](#external-calls), External types must be used. The types usable in Flint are:  
  
 - `int8`, `int16`, `int24`, ... `int256` (all multiples of 8 bits)  
 - `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint24`, ... `uint256` (all multiples of 8 bits)  
 - `address`  
 - `string`  
 - `bool`  
 - `bytes32`  
  
> Note that only `bool`, `uint64`, `address` are available in MoveIR due to target restrictions  
  
See [casting](#casting-to-and-from-solidity-types) for more information.  -->
  
## Constants and variables  
  
Constants and variables associate a name with a value of a particular [type](#types). The value of a constant cannot be changed once it is set `unimplemented`, whereas a variable can be set to a different value with assignment statements.  
  
Constants and variables of a contract are its state properties. They are data stored in the EVM storage, and even though they are not directly modifiable, they are publicly visible, so they should never hold private or sensitive data.  
  
Otherwise, local constants and variables are declared inside functions. These are specific to a given transaction, stored in the EVM memory. Even though these terms are not part of a contract's state, if they are part of an executed transaction their values will still be recorded in the transaction history.  
  
To declare a constant with the name `<name>` of the type `<type>` with the initial value being the result of `<expression>`:  
  
```swift  
let <name>: <type> = <expression>  
```  
  
The expression is evaluated once, when the declaration is executed. The expression can be complex, or just a simple [literal](#literals). Examples:  
  
```swift  
let unity: Int = 1  
let answer: Int = 7 * 6  
let usingFlint: Bool = true  
let digitsOfPi: [Int] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]  
let structExample: Rectangle = Rectangle(width: 30, height: 40)  
```  
  
If a constant is a state property of a contract, it may be given no initial value, but in that case it must be set `unimplemented` in each initialiser of that contract:  
  
```swift  
let <name>: <type>  
```  
  
To declare a variable with the name `<name>` of the type `<type>` with the initial value being the result of `<expression>` (see [expressions](#expressions)), the syntax is the same, but `var` is used instead of `let`:  
  
```swift  
var <name>: <type> = <expression>  
```  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
var counter: Int = 0  
var areWeThereYet: Bool = false  
```  
  
The value of a variable or a constant can be used in expressions once it is declared, simply by writing its name.  
  
## Functions  
  
Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task, which are called using their identifier. They are defined with the keyword `func` followed by the identifier and the set of parameters and optional return type:  
  
To declare a function with the name `<name>` returning a value of type `<type>`, taking the list of [parameters `<parameters>`](#function-parameters), optionally with [modifiers `<modifiers>`](#function-modifiers) and [attributes `<attributes>`](#function-attributes):  
  
```swift  
<attributes>  
<modifiers> func <name>(<parameter-1>, <parameter-2>, ...) -> <type> {  
    <statement>*
}  
```  
  
Some functions do not return a value:  
  
```swift  
<attributes>  
<modifiers> func <name>(<parameter-1>, <parameter-2>, ...) {  
    <statement>*
}  
```  
  
<!-- No longer relevant ### Function attributes  
  
Attributes annotate functions as having special properties. Currently the only example of this is `@payable`. For more information, see [payable](#payable). --> 
  
### Function modifiers  
  
In Flint all functions are `private` by default and as such can only be accessed from within the contract body. This can be changed using access modifiers:  
  
 - `public` access enables functions to be used within their contract and exposes the function to the interface of the contract as a whole when compiled. Other contracts and users on the Ethereum network may call `public` functions directly.  
 - `private` access (default and not a keyword that is explicitly set) only enables functions to be used within their contract.  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
func giveOutMoney(to: Address) {  
    // only callable from other contract functions
}  
  
public func takeMoney(from: Address) {  
    // can be called by Ethereum users and contracts
}
```  
  
Smart contracts can remain in activity for a large number of years, during which a large number of state mutations can occur. To aid with reasoning, Flint functions cannot mutate smart contractsâ€™ state by default. This helps avoid accidental state mutations when writing the code, and allows readers to easily draw their attention to the mutating functions of the smart contract.  
  
Naturally, it is sometimes desirable to write a function that changes the state properties of its contract. This is enabled with the `mutates (...)` modifier:  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
contract Counter {  
    var hits: Int = 0
}  
  
Counter :: (any) {  
    // This would be a compile-time error - the function needs to be declared
    // with `mutates (...)`! 
    //   public func incrementA() { 
    //       hits += 1 
    //   }  
    // This can compile: 
    public func incrementB() mutates (hits) { 
        hits += 1
    }
}
```  
  
### Function parameters  
  
Functions can also take parameters which can be used within the function. These must be declared in the function signature. Flint also supports parameters that take default values, but no non-defaulted parameter may follow one that has a default value.  
  
Each parameter has the syntax:  
  
```swift  
<modifiers> <name>: <type modifiers> <type>  
```  
  
Currently the only possible (optional) `<modifier>` is `implicit` `unimplemented`.  See [payable](#payable) for more information. The only possible (optional) `<type modifier>` is `inout`. See [inout](#structs-as-function-arguments) for more information.  
  
Below is a function that [mutates](#function-modifiers) the dictionary of peoples' names to add the key/value pair of the caller's address and the given name. If the parameter `name` is not provided to the function call, then the default value of `"John Doe"` will be used. For more information about callers, see [caller bindings](#caller-group-variable).  
  
```swift  
contract AddressBook {
    var people: [Address: String]
}
  
AddressBook :: caller <- (any) {  
    func remember(name: String = "John Doe") mutates (people) { people[caller] = name }
}
```  
  
### Return values  
  
You can optionally indicate the return type of a function with the return arrow `->`, which is followed by the return type. Inside the function, a `return` statement must be used, to return a value of the same type as the declared return type.  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
func hello() -> String {  
    return "Hello, world!"
}
```  
  
If the return type is omitted, the function is considered a `Void` function, and a call to it cannot be used in expressions as a value.  
  
### Initialisers  
  
Initialisers are special functions called to create a struct or contract instance. The syntax is slightly different:  
  
```swift  
<modifiers> init(<parameter-1>, <parameter-2>, ...) {  
    // statements
}  
```  
  
The statements that can be used in initialisers are limited to "simple" statements, which means no external calls, control flow statements, etc. After an initialiser is executed, all the state properties of its containing struct or contract should have a value.  
  
<!-- no longer relevant? ### Fallback  
_Only in: Contracts on Solidity_  
  
Fallback functions are another special kind of function, with a slightly modified declaration syntax:  
  
```swift  
public fallback() {  
 // statements}  
```  
  
Fallback functions should only contain "simple" statements, just like initialisers. They are called whenever an attempt has been made to call a non-existent function of the containing contract. This may happen e.g. if the caller used an incorrect signature for the call. Oftentimes the Gas allocation for fallback execution is very low (`2300`), which only allows an [event](#events) to be logged.  -->
  
## Structs  
  
Structs in Flint are general-purpose constructs that group state and methods that can be used as self-contained blocks. They use the same syntax as defining constants and variables for properties. Structure methods are not protected as they can only be called by contract functions, and are required to be annotated `mutates (...)` if they mutate the struct's state.  
  
### Declaration  
  
The syntax of a struct declaration is:  
  
```swift  
struct <name> {  
 // variables, constants, methods}  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
struct Rectangle {  
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0  
    func area() -> Int { 
        return width * height
    }
}
```  
  
### Instances  
  
The declaration of a struct only describes what types of variables it contains, what their initial values are, and what methods may be used to modify or access the struct data. To create concrete instances, each with individual data values, an instance has to be created, by calling the initialiser of a struct.  
  
```swift  
<struct-name>(<initialiser-parameter-values>)  
``` 

Example:  
  
```swift  
let someRectangle: Rectangle = Rectangle()  
```  
  
When an instance is created, it is initialised with its initial values â€“ in this case a width and height of `0`. This process can also be done manually using an [initialiser](#initialisers). Defining initialisers is also required when default values are not specified for all properties of a struct. You can access the properties of the current struct with the special keyword [`self`](#self).  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
struct Rectangle {  
    // Same definition as above, with extra: 
    public init(width: Int, height: Int) {
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }
}  
```  
  
```swift  
let bigRectangle = Rectangle(width: 400, height: 10000)  
```  
  
### Accessing properties/methods  
  
Properties/methods of a struct instance can be accessed by writing the property/method name immediately after the instance identifier, separated by a period `.`:  
  
```swift  
<struct-instance>.<variable-name>  
<struct-instance>.<constant-name>  
<struct-instance>.<method-name>(<function-parameter-values>)  
```  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
bigRectangle.width // 400  
bigRectangle.area() // evaluates to 4000000 by calling the `area` function  
```  

### Structs as function arguments  
  
Structs can be passed by reference using the `inout` type modifier. The struct is then treated as an implicit reference to the value in the caller. Any modifications made to the struct will still be visible after the function is called `unimplemented (move)`.  
  
When calling a function with an `inout` parameter, the given struct instance must be prefixed with `&` to indicate it is being passed by reference.  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
struct S {  
    var x: Int  
    init(x: Int) { self.x = x }
}  
  
func foo() {  
    let s: S = S(x: 8)  
    byReference(s: &s)  
    // Here s.x == 10  
    // This is not supported: //byValue(s: s)  
    // Here s.x == 10 would still be true.
}  
  
func byReference(s: inout S) {  
    s.x = 10
}
```  

## Contracts  
  
Contracts lie at the heart of Flint. They are the core building blocks of a program's code. Constants and variables can be defined inside contracts to be stored in the Ethereum network.  
  
### Declaration  
  
The declaration of a Flint contract consists of multiple parts. The properties are declared in a single block using the keyword `contract` followed by the contract name that will be used as the identifier.  
  
```swift  
contract <name> {  
    // constant and variable declarations, event declarations
}  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
contract Bank {  
    var owner: Address
    let name: String = "Bank"
}  
```  
  
### Type states  
  
Flint introduces the concept of type states. Insufficient and incorrect state management in Solidity code have led to security vulnerabilities and unexpected behaviour in widely deployed smart contracts. Avoiding these vulnerabilities by the design of the language is a strong advantage.  
  
Type states of a contract represent the possible states it can be in. At any point of time, the contract on the network can only exist in a single state. Special [`become` statements](#become-statements) can be used within functions to move the contract to a different type state.  
  
A contract declaration may optionally include a list of its type states:  
  
```swift  
contract <name> (<type-state-1>, <type-state-2>, ...) {  
    // constant and variable declarations, event declarations
}  
```  
  
Type states should be valid identifiers, starting with a capital letter.  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
contract Auction (Preparing, InProgress, Terminated) {}  
```  
  
Using [type state protection](#type-state-protection), it is possible to specify that only certain functions will be callable when the contract is in a given type state.  
  
### Protection blocks  
  
The remaining parts of a contract are its protection blocks. While traditional computer programs have an entry point (the `main` function), smart contracts do not. After a contract is deployed on the blockchain, its code does not run until an Ethereum transaction is received. Smart contracts are in fact more akin to RESTful web services presenting API endpoints. It is important to prevent unauthorised parties from calling sensitive functions.  
  
In Flint, functions of a contract are declared within protection blocks, which restrict when the enclosed functions are allowed to be called.  
  
There are two elements to protection blocks, the [caller group](#caller-group) and the optional [type state protection](#type-state-protection) (see [type states](#type-states) for more detail).  
  
A minimal protection block of contract `<contract-name>` with the [caller group](#caller-group) `<caller-group>` is declared as:  
  
```swift  
<contract-name> :: (<caller-group>) {  
    // functions
}  
```  
  
The caller can optionally be captured into a variable (see [caller group variable](#caller-group-variable)):  
  
```swift  
<contract-name> :: <variable> <- (<caller-group>) {  
    // functions
}  
```  
  
The protection block can optionally also check that the contract is in a given [type state](#type-states) (see [type state protection](#type-state-protection)):  
  
```swift  
<contract-name> @(<type-state>) :: (<caller-group>) {  
    // functions
}  
```  
  
Alternatively, protection blocks can be declared within the contract declaration part with the same syntax but using `self` instead of the contract name `unimplemented`:  
  
```swift  
contract <contract-name> {  
    // ... self :: (<caller-group>) { 
        // ...
    }
}
```  
  
Solidity, for example, uses function modifiers to insert dynamic checks in functions, which can for instance abort unauthorised calls. However, it is easy to forget to specify these checks, as the language does not require programmers to write them.  
  
Having a language construct which protects functions from invalid calls could require programmers to systematically think about which parties should be able to call the functions they are about to define.  
  
In Flint, functions of a contract are declared within protection blocks, which protect the functions from invalid access.  
  
#### Caller group  
  
Caller groups consist of a list of caller members enclosed in parentheses. These caller members may be identified using multiple mechanisms, as listed below. Functions inside protection blocks can only be called by an Ethereum address (the "caller" address) that satisfies at least one of the caller members of that protection block.  
  
| Name | Flint type | Callable when |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Predicate function | `Address -> Bool` | The function is called with the caller as input, must return `true`. |  
| 0-ary function | `() -> Address` | The returned address must match the caller address. |  
| State property (single address) | `Address` | The address property must match the caller address. |  
| State property (list of addresses) | `[Address]` or `Address[n]` | The caller address must be contained within the list of addresses. |  
| State property (dictionary of addresses) | `[T: Address]` | The caller address must be contained with in the values of the dictionary. |  
| Any | `any` | Always. |  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
contract Bank {  
    let owner: Address var managers: [Address]
}  
  
Bank :: (owner, managers) {  
    // ...
}  
  
contract Lottery {}  
  
Lottery :: (lucky) {  
    func lucky(address: Address) -> Bool {
        // return true or false
    }
}  
```  
  
The address of the caller of a function is unforgeable. It is not possible to impersonate another user, as a consequence of both Ethereumâ€™s mechanism which generates public addresses from private keys and MoveIR's transaction system. On Ethereum, transactions are signed using a private key, and determine the public key of the caller. Stealing a caller capability would hence require stealing a private key. The recommended way for Ethereum users to transfer their ability to call functions is to either change the backing address of the caller capability they have (the smart contract must have a function which allows this), or to securely send their private key to the new owner, outside of the Ethereum platform.  
  
Calls to Flint functions are validated both at compile-time and runtime, with runtime checks only being added where necessary.  
  
#### Caller group variable  
  
It is sometimes useful to know which address initiated the current transaction, in addition to verifying it with caller groups. This is possible with the optional caller group variable.  
  
```swift  
<contract-name> :: <variable> <- (<caller-group>) {  
    // functions
}  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
contract AddressBook {
    var book: [Address: String] = [:]
}  
  
AddressBook :: address <- (any) {  
    public func remember(name: String) { book[address] = name }
}
```  
  
#### Type state protection  
  
A protection block may also be used to ensure that certain functions are only called when the contract is in a given type state.  
  
```swift  
<contract-name> @(<type-state>) :: (<caller-group>) {  
    // functions
}
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
contract Poll(Open, CountingVotes, Result) {  
    // ...
}  
  
Poll @(Open) :: (any) {  
    public func voteFor(option: String) {
        // ... 
    }
}  
```  
  
In this example the `voteFor` function could only be called when the `Poll` was in the `Open` state.  
  
#### Static checking  
  
In a Flint function, if a function call to another Flint function is performed, the compiler checks that the caller meets the caller protection.  
  
Consider the following example:  
  
```swift  
Bank :: (any) {
    func foo() {
        // Error: Protection "any" cannot be used to perform a call to a 
        // function for "manager" bar() 
    }
}  

Bank :: (manager) {  
    func bar() {}
}  
```  
  
Within the context of `foo`, the caller is regarded as `any`. It is not certain that the caller also satisfies the `manager` protection, so the compiler rejects the call.  
  
#### Dynamic checking  
  
In the above example, it is still possible for `foo` to satisfy the protections of the function `bar`. For such cases, two additional language constructs exist:  
  
 - `try? bar()`: The function `bar` is called if, at runtime, the protections are satisfied (i.e. the caller satisfies the caller protection and the state of the contract satisfies the type state protection). The expression `try? bar()` returns a boolean if successful.  
 - `try! bar()`: If at runtime `bar` protections are not satisfied an exception is thrown (reverting the transaction) and the function is not executed.  
  
#### Multiple protections  
  
A contract behaviour declaration can be restricted by multiple caller protections. Consider the following contract behavior declaration:  
  
```swift  
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {  
    func forManagerOrCustomers() {}
}  
```  
  
The function `forManagerOrCustomers` can be called either by the manager, or by any of the accounts registered in the bank.  
  
Calls to functions of multiple protections are accepted if **each** of the protections of the enclosing function are compatible with **any** of the target function's protections.  
  
Consider the following examples:  
  
```swift  
// Insufficient protections  
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {  
    func forManagerOrCustomers() {
      // Error: `accounts` is not compatible with `manager`
      forManager() 
    }
}  
Bank :: (manager) {  
    func forManager() {}
}
```  
  
```swift  
// Sufficient protections  
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {  
    func forManagerOrCustomers() {
        // Valid: "manager" is compatible with "manager", and "accounts" is
        // compatible with "accounts"
        forManagerOrCustomers2()
    }
}  
  
Bank :: (accounts, manager) {  
    func forManagerOrCustomers2() {}
}  
```  
  
```swift  
// `any` is compatible with any caller protection  
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {
    func forManagerOrCustomers() {
        // Valid: "manager" is compatible with "manager" (and "any", too), and "accounts" 
        // is compatible with "any" 
        forManagerOrCustomers2()
    }
}  
  
// The caller protection "manager" has no effect: "any" is compatible with any caller protection  
Bank :: (manager, any) {  
    func forManagerOrCustomers2() {}
}  
```  
  
### Visibility Modifiers  
  
Variables declared in the contract can have modifiers in front of their declaration which control the automatic synthesis of variable accessors and mutators. By the nature of smart contracts all storage is visible already, but providing accessors makes that process easier. Note that this automated synthesis can only occur for fields of non-dyanmic types. 
  
 - `public` access synthesises an accessor and a mutator so that the storage variable can be viewed and changed by anyone.  
 - `visible` access synthesises an accessor to the storage variable which allows it to be viewed by anyone.  
 - `private` access means that nothing is synthesised (but both accessors and mutators can still be manually specified).  
  
An accessor, if synthesised for variable `<name>` or type `<type>`, has the signature `public func get<Name>() -> <type>`. A mutator, if synthesised for the same variable, has the signature `public func set<Name>(to: <type>) mutates (<Name>)`.  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
public var value: Int  
visible var name: String = "Bank"  
```  
  
The above declarations cause these functions to be synthesised:  
  
```swift  
public func getValue() -> Int  
public func setValue(to: Int)  
public func getName() -> String  
```  
  
## Traits  

> **Planned feature**
> Right now, traits for non-external types are not implemented.
  
Flint has the concept of 'traits', based in part on [traits in the Rust language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait.html). Traits describe the partial behaviour of the contracts or structs which conform to them. For contracts, traits constitute a collection of functions, function signatures in protection blocks, and events. For structs, traits only constitute a collection of functions and function signatures.  
  
Contracts or structs can conform to multiple traits. The Flint compiler enforces the implementation of function signatures in the trait and allows usage of the functions declared in them. Traits allow a level of abstraction and code reuse for contracts and structs.  
   
### Struct traits  `unimplemented`
  
Traits can be declared for structs using the syntax:  
  
```swift  
struct trait <trait-name> {  
    // trait members
}  
```  
  
Structs can conform to struct traits using the syntax:  
  
```swift  
struct <struct-name>: <trait-1>, <trait-2>, ... {  
    // ...
}  
```  
  
Struct traits can contain functions, function signatures, initialisers, and initialiser signatures. A function or initialiser signature simply declares the name (for a function) and parameter types, without providing the actual code implementation.  
  
Example:  
  
In this example we define an `Animal` struct trait. The `Person` struct then conforms to the `Animal` trait.  
  
```swift  
struct trait Animal {  
    // Must have an empty and named initialiser. public init() public init(name: String)  
    // These are signatures that conforming structures must implement // access properties of the structure. 
    func isNamed() -> Bool
    public func name() -> String
    public func noise() -> String  
    
    // This is a pre-implemented function using the functions already in the trait. 
    public func speak() -> String {
        if isNamed() { 
            return name()
        } else {
            return noise() 
        }
    }
}  
  
struct Person: Animal {  
    let name: String
    public init() { self.name = "John Doe" } 
    public init(name: String) { self.name = name }  
    
    // People always have a name, it's just not always known. 
    func isNamed() -> Bool { return true }  
    
    // These access the properties of the struct. 
    public func name() -> String { return self.name }  
    public func noise() -> String { return "Huh?" }  
    
    // Person can also have functions in addition to Animal. public func greet() -> String {
        return "Hi"
    }
}  
```  
  
### Contract traits  `unimplemented`
  
Traits can be declared for contracts using the syntax:  
  
```swift  
contract trait <trait-name> {  
    // trait members
}  
```  
  
Contracts can conform to contract traits using the following syntax for their declaration part:  
  
```swift  
contract <contract-name>: <trait-1>, <trait-2>, ... {  
    // ...
}  
```  
  
Contract traits can contain anonymous contract behaviour declarations containing functions, function signatures, and events.  

  
### External traits  `unimplemented`

External traits allow interfacing with contracts (and resources) from the target language. Traits can be declared for external contracts using the syntax:  
  
```swift  
<attributes>  
external trait <trait-name> {  
    // trait members
}  
```  
  
See the [specifying the interface of external calls](#specifying-the-interface) section for more information.  
  
### Polymorphic self  
  
`Self` (note the capital 'S') is a special type available only in struct and contract traits. It refers to the type that implements the current trait, but not any other type that conforms to that trait. This is particularly useful when providing default implementations for functions in a trait. See [assets](#assets) for an example in the standard library.  
  
Example without `Self`:  
  
```swift  
struct trait Unit {  
    func add(source: inout Unit)
}  
  
struct Metre: Unit {  
    var length: Int = 0 func add(source: inout Unit) {
        length += source.length // compilation error here 
    }
}  
```  
  
In the above example, we only want to be able to add metres to metres. Accessing `source.length` is invalid, because `length` is only declared in `Metre`. Instead, using `Self`:  
  
```swift  
struct trait Unit {  
    func add(source: inout Self)
}  
  
struct Metre: Unit {  
    var length: Int = 0
    func add(source: inout Metre) mutates (length) {
        length += source.length
    }
}
  
struct Litre: Unit {  
    var volume: Int = 0 func add(source: inout Litre) mutates (volume) { 
        volume += source.volume
    }
}
```  
  
In this example, both `Metre` and `Litre` are valid. But it would a call like `aMetreInstance.add(source: &aLitreInstance)` would cause a compile-time error.  
  
## Expressions  
  
Expressions are at the core of any computation done in Flint code. Evaluating an expression results in a single value of a given type. Expressions can be nested to arbitrary layers.  
  
The expressions available in Flint are:  
  
| Name | Syntax | Description |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Literal | `1`, `"hello"`, `false`, etc. | Constant value; see [literals](#literals). |  
| Range `unimplemented` | `<expr-1>..<<expr-2>`, `<expr-1>...<expr-2>` | See [ranges](#range-types). |  
| Binary expression | `<expr-1> <op> <expr-2>` | A binary operation `<op>` applied to the expressions `<expr-1>` and `<expr-2>`; see [operators](#operators). |  
| Struct reference | `&<expr>` | See [structs as function arguments](#structs-as-function-arguments). |  
| Function call | `<function-name>(<param-1>: <expr-1>, <param-2>: <expr-2>, ...)` | Call to the function `<function-name>` with the results of the given expressions `<expr-1,2,...>` as parameters. See [function calls](#function-calls). |  
| Dot access | `<expr-1>.<field>` | Access to the `<field>` field (variable, constant, function) or the result of `<expr-1>`. |  
| Index / key access | `<expr-1>[<expr-2>]` | Access to the given key of a list or dictionary. _(Only on Solidity)_ |  
| External call `unimplemented (eWASM)` | `call <external-contract>.<function-name>(<param-1>: <expr-1>, <param-2>: <expr-2>, ...)` | Call to the function of an external contract; see [external calls](#external-calls). |  
| Type cast | `cast <expr> to <type>` | Forced cast of the result of `<expr>` to `<type>`; see [casting to and from Solidity types](#casting-to-and-from-solidity-types). |  
| Attempt | `try? <call>`, `try! <call>` | Attempt to call a function in a different protection block, see [dynamic checking](#dynamic-checking). |  
  
### Function calls  
  
Functions can then be called from within a contract protection block with the same identifier. The call arguments must be provided in the same order as the one they are declared in (in the function signature), and they must be labeled accordingly (the exception for this is [struct initialisers](#instances)). If any of the optional parameters are not provided, then their default values are used automatically `unimplemented`.
  
````swift  
public func apply(name: String) mutates (balances) {  
    bankroll(applicant: caller, amount: stake)
    ...
}  
  
func bankroll (applicant: Address, amount: Int ) mutates (balances) {  
    balances[applicant] = amount
}  
````  
  
## Literals  
  
Literals represent fixed values in the source code that can be assigned to constants and variables.  
  
### Integer literals  
  
Integer literals (Flint type `Int`) can be written as decimal numbers. The size of the `Int` type in Flint is 64 bits (8 bytes). Underscores can be used to separate digits of integer literals.  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
42  
2020  
1_22_333  
10_000_000_000_000_000_000 
```  
  
### Address literals  
  
Address literals (Flint type `Address`) are written as 40 hexadecimal digits prefixed by a `0x`. Addresses are an important concept on blockchains, referring to other contracts and accounts. Underscores can be used to separate digits of address literals.  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
0x1234123412341234123412341234123412341234  
0x0CB1DB10A4820BD10823AE0101F02198CAFEBABE  
0xCAFEBABE_CAFEBABE_CAFEBABE_CAFEBABE_CAFEBABE  
```  
  
### Boolean literals  
  
Boolean literals (Flint type `Bool`) are simply `true` and `false`.  
  
### String literals  
  
String literals (Flint type `String`) are sets of characters enclosed in double quotes `"..."`.  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
""  
"hello"  
"This is a sentence."  
```  

### List literals 
  
List literals (Flint type `[T]` or `T[n]` for some Flint type `T`).

Examples:
```swift
[]
[1, 2, 3]
``` 

### Dictionary literals 
  
Dictionary literals (Flint type `[T: U]` for some Flint types `T` and `U`).

Examples:
```swift
[:]
[2 : 8, 3 : 9] 
```

### Self  
  
The special keyword `self` refers to the current struct instance or contract containing the current function.  
  
## Operators  
  
An operator is a special symbol used to check, change, or combine values. Flint supports common Swift operators and attempts to eliminate common coding errors.  
  
### Arithmetic operators  
  
Flint supports the following arithmetic operators for `Int` expressions:  
  
 - `+` - Addition  
 - `-` - Subtraction  
 - `*` - Multiplication  
 - `/` - Division  
 - `**` - Exponentiation  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
1 + 2 // equals 3  
5 - 3 // equals 2  
2 * 3 // equals 6  
10 / 2 // equals 5  
2 ** 3 // equals 8  
```  
  
Flint has unique safe arithmetic. The `+`, `-`, `*` and `**` operators throw an exception and abort execution of the smart contract when an overflow occurs `unimplemented`. The `/` operator implements integer division. No underflows can occur as floating-point numbers are not supported yet. The performance overhead of the safe operators is low.  
  
In rare cases, allowing overflows is the intended behaviour. Flint also supports  
overflowing operators, which will not crash on overflow: `unimplemented` 
  
 - `&+` - Unsafe addition  
 - `&-` - Unsafe subtraction  
 - `&*` - Unsafe multiplication  
  
> _Move-specific:_ Due to MoveIR not allowing unsafe operations, unsafe operators are translated into safe operators, so act like `+`, `-`, and `*`  
  
### Boolean operators  
  
These operators all result in `Bool`:  
  
 - `==` - Equal to  
 - `!=` - Not equal to  
 - `||` - Logical or  
 - `&&` - Logical and  
 - `<` - Less than  
 - `<=` - Less than or equal to  
 - `>` - Greater than  
 - `>=` - Greater than or equal to  
  
Examples:  
  
```swift  
1 == 1 // true because 1 is equal to 1  
2 != 1 // true because 2 is not equal to 1  
2 > 1 // true because 2 is greater than 1  
1 < 2 // true because 1 is less than 2  
1 >= 1 // true because 1 is greater than or equal to 1  
2 <= 1 // false because 2 is not less than or equal to 1  
true || false // true because one of true and false is true  
true && false // false because one of true and false is false  
```  
  
## Statements  
  
Statements control the execution of code in a function, enable looping, conditional behaviour, and more.  
  
### Variable/constant declaration and assignment  
  
Declaration of variables and constants is a statement (see [variables and constants](#constants-and-variables)). Syntax:  
  
```swift  
let <name>: <type> = <expression>  
let <name>: <type>  
var <name>: <type> = <expression>  
var <name>: <type>  
```  
  
#### Compound assignment  
  
Flint also provides compound assignment statements that combine assignment (`=`) with another operator. Namely:  
  
 - `+=` Compound addition  
 - `-=` Compound subtraction  
 - `*=` Compound times  
 - `/=` Compound division  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
x += 5  
// is equivalent to:  
x = x + 5  
```  
  
<!-- TODO not implemented ### Loops  
  
`for-in` loops can be used to iterate over sequence. Currently this supports lists, dictionary values and [ranges](#range-types). Syntax:  
  
```swift  
for let <variable-name>: <type> in <sequence> {  
 // ...}  
```  
  
Alternatively, the iteration value can be a variable, so it can be modified, though modifications are reset on each loop:  
  
```swift  
for var <variable-name>: <type> in <sequence> {  
 // ...}  
```  
  
Example:  
  
Assuming a variable-length list `names` (of type `[String]`), it can be iterated over, binding the current iteration value to the constant `name` of type `String`, using:  
  
```swift  
for let name: String in names {  
 // do something with `name`}  
``` --> 
  
### Conditionals  
  
The `if` statement allows executing different code based on the result of a condition (of Flint type `Bool`). Syntax:  
  
```swift  
if <condition> {  
    // ...
}  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
if x == 2 {  
    // ...
}  
```  
  
#### Else clauses  
  
The `if` statement can also provide an alternative set of statements known as an `else` clause which gets executed when the condition evaluates to `false`. Syntax:  
  
```swift  
if <condition> {  
    // ...
} else {  
    // ...
}  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
if x == 2 {  
    // ...
} else {  
    // ...
}  
```  
  
### Become statements  
_Only on: Contracts_  
  
The `become` statement can be used to change the type state (see [type states](#type-states)) of the current contract. The execution of code is terminated after a `become` statement is executed, and the contract will then transition to the specified type state. Syntax:  
  
```swift  
become <type-state>  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
contract Semaphore(Red, Green) {}  
  
Semaphore @(Red) :: (any) {  
    public func wait() { become Green }
}  
  
Semaphore @(Green) :: (any) {  
    public func wait() { become Red }
}  
```  
  
### Return statements  
  
A `return` statement can be used to provide the output value of a function with a declared return type (see [functions](#functions)). Syntax:  
  
```swift  
return <expression>  
```  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
Semaphore @(Red) :: (any) {  
    public func countWaitingCars() -> Int { return 200 }
}  
```  
  
<!-- TODO ### Do-catch blocks  
  
`do-catch` blocks can be used to handle errors in execution in a controlled manner. Currently, the only supported error is an external call error (see [external calls](#external-calls)). Syntax:  
  
```swift  
do {  
 // ...} catch is ExternalCallError {  
 // ...}  
```  -->
  
## External calls  
 
`unimplemented eWASM`
External calls refer to a Flint contract calling the functions of other contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. They also allow money to be transferred from Flint contracts to other accounts and contracts, enabling full participation in the Ethereum network.  
  
However, external contracts include their own set of possible risks and security considerations. When writing code that interacts with external contracts, it is important to keep in mind that:  
  
 1. External contracts may execute arbitrary code when called â€“ although the called contract does not have access to the memory or state storage of the calling (Flint) contract, it may still cause problems. In particular, care should be taken when handling the output returned from an external contract. Additionally, the external contract may call arbitrary function of the calling (Flint) contract, potentially resulting in a re-entrancy attack.  
 2. Interfaces of external contracts may be incorrectly specified â€“ since the EVM does not retain any type information, it is up to the programmer to correctly specify the functions available on an external contract. If the interface is specified incorrectly, this may lead to the wrong function being called and money being lost.  

### Specifying the interface  
  
The interface of an external contract is specified using a special `external` trait. Syntax:  
  
```swift  
<attributes>  
external trait <trait-name> {  
 // functions}  
```  
  
The functions declared inside an external trait may not include any modifiers, and their parameters and return types (if used) must be specified using [External types](#external-types) on Ethereum. On Move, they may return Move structs.  
  
Currently, deploying contracts from within Flint code is not supported, so neither initialisers nor fallbacks can be provided in external traits.  
  
Example:  
  
```swift  
external trait ExternalBank {  
 func pay() -> int256 func withdraw(amount: int256) -> int256}

### Calling functions  
  
Functions of an external contract instance may be called using the keyword `call`. Flint provides two modes of operation for external calls, and they are semantically similar to `try` in Swift.  
  
```swift  
call <contract>.<function-name>(<parameters>)  
call! <contract>.<function-name>(<parameters>)  
```  
  
The forced mode is invoked with the syntax `call!` (note the exclamation mark). If the external call fails for any reason (e.g. the external contract runs out of gas), the entire transaction will revert.  
  
```swift  
X :: (any) {  
    public func callback(externalAddress: Address) {
        let extInstance = Ext(address: externalAddress)
        call! extInstance.someFunction()
    }
}
```  

## Enumerations

An enumeration defines a common group of values with the same type and enables working with those values in a type-safe way within Flint code. The syntax is:

```swift
enum <name>: <associated-type> {
  case <case-name>
  // additional cases...
}
```

Example:

```swift
enum CompassPoint: Int {
  case north
  case south
  case east
  case west
}
```

The values defined in an enumeration (such as `north`, `south`, `east` and `west`) are its enumeration cases. Each enumeration defines a new user-defined type. To access a given case, dot syntax is used:
`unimplemented`

```swift
<enum-name>.<case-name>
```

Example:

```swift
var direction: CompassPoint
direction = CompassPoint.north
```

### Associated Values

You can assign raw values to enumeration cases. The values need to match the type associated with the enumeration. Flint will also try to infer the raw value of cases by default based on the raw value of the last declared enumeration case.

Example:

```swift
enum Numbers: Int {
  case one = 1
  case two = 2
  case three // Numbers.three == 3
  case four // Numbers.four == 4
}
```
